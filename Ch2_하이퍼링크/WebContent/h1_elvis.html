<br>
<font size=3>Wise men say,
<br> only fools rush in
<br> But I can't help,
<br> falling in love with you
<br> Shall I stay?
<br> Would it be a sin?
<br> If I, I can't help,
<br> falling in love with you
<br> Like a river flows,
<br> surely to the sea
<br> Darling so it goes,
<br> some things aren't meant to be
<br> Take my hand,
<br> take my whole life too
<br> For I, I can't help,
<br> falling in love with you
<br> Take my hand,
<br> take my whole life too
<br> For I, I can't help,
<br> falling in love with you
<br> No I, I can't help,
<br> falling in love with you

<br>Come hold me tight
<br>Kiss me my darling
<br>Be mine tonight
<br>Tomorrow will be too late
<br>It's now or never
<br>My love won't wait
<br>When I first saw you
<br>With your smile so tender
<br>My heart was captured
<br>My soul surrendered
<br>I spent a lifetime
<br>waiting for the right time
<br>Now that you're near the time is here
<br>at last
<br>It's now or never
<br>Come hold me tight Kiss me
<br>my darling Be mine tonight
<br>Tomorrow will be too late
<br>It's now or never
<br>My love won't wait
<br>Just like a willow..
<br>We would cry an ocean
<br>If we lost true love
<br>and sweet devotion
<br>Your lips excite me
<br>Let your arms invite me
<br>For who knows when
<br>we'll meet again this way
<br>It's now or never
<br>Come hold me tight Kiss me
<br>my darling Be mine tonight
<br>Tomorrow will be too late..
<br>It's now or never
<br>My love won't wait
<br>It's now or never
<br>My love won't wait
<br>It's now or never
<br>My love won't wait
<br>It's now or never
